# Team-Profile-Generator

# Description

This app has been used with nodejs, and is a command-line application that accepts user input to generate a HTML file, with an org structure. Class contructors have been used for respective personas selected from the options for role type, which then inherits the methods and properties from the employee class to populate sections of the rendered HTML page. Jest has been used to test functions to guide and highlight problems with code functions. 

# Usage
